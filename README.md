### Description
This project was designed and created as a full-stack dynamic web application in fulfillment of Skill Distillery's final project requirements. It is an application which uses REST architecture to create RESTful web services. The main idea is for users to find inspiration and new ideas for travel which might have otherwise not occurred to them.

The application is socially-centric, relying on users who post about trips and the information therein to provide content on the website for other users to get ideas from. Users can follow people and have followers. When a user posts a trip, it becomes available to be seen by other users,  through one of three ways: through the search feature, through the discovery feature (randomized trip listings), or appearing on the feed (if the user is following the person who posted the trip). When a user views a trip, it takes them to that trip's detail page where they can see more information about that trip, such as a review, prices, location, more pictures, additional resources and resource links, warnings & personal tips from the poster. Additionally, the user has the option to bookmark that trip for later reference. The user's profile page will list all the trips that that user has posted about and also all the trips the user has bookmarked from other people.

When users follow each other, they get access to updates on their feed as to when people they follow post new trips. These trip postings contain a short message which will display to the feed and become clickable links to the trip detail page. There is a "discover" feature on the feed page for all users as well, which, when clicked, provides an easily viewable listing of randomized trips that the user has not bookmarked or seen before, in order to provide new ideas and inspiration about travel for that user.

* Register users

* Follow people and see their trip postings
* Bookmark trips for later reference
* Functional feed page, displaying posted trips (personal and from people users follow)
* Discover feature to find new & randomized trip listings
* Search page and feature
* Trip detail page containing: review, prices, personal tips & warnings, extra pictures

### Stretch Goals and Unimplemented Features
Due to time constraints, many of the ideas we had wanted to incorporate we were not able to fully realize. At a later time, it would be nice to incorporate some of our initial ideas which didn't make it into the final presentation of this application. We would have liked to have incorporated commenting on the feed, so that users may post generic messages between followed/followers - furthermore, the ability to comment on trip posts, perhaps as to provide more insight, praise, or viewpoints. Direct messaging to followed/followers would have also been useful to get more information about trips. We wanted to be able to utilize Google Maps API more in-depth so that we could highlight places of interest that a user would have encountered on their trip. For example, a user may drop pins on the map for highlighted areas which become links to other resources or internal pages which have more specified information on that place. A fully realized "discover" page was in plans to be created so that users would see a large listing of various trips that could be aggregated and filtered through.
